# Preparation Guide

Automation for Windows environments can be tricky. 
Due to its particularities and Operating System architecture, setting up this environment may require additional time. However, the good news is: this is a preparation that is done only once. Then, just develop the playbooks according to your needs and youâ€™re done. I will leave the ones I developed for my project to serve you as a guide.

# Infrastructure Requirements

Putting together the information from the providers, a server with the configuration below can be a good starting point:
- 8GB RAM,
- 100GB disk
- 2 processing cores

Other important infrastructure requirements:
- DNS entry, to allow access by name
- Configuring Firewall Rules to allow connection between the Ansible server and Active Directory
- Enable the WinRM service on Active Directory servers to allow remote access (using connection via HTTPS)

# Preparing the Server

In this scenario, I deployed Ansible and Jenkins on the same server (that uses Ubuntu 22.04), using the Azure cloud. However, from this point on, the chosen architecture (on-premises or cloud) will make little difference.
You can check the compatible OS versions [here][https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/installation_distros.html].
Starting from the scratch, you can prepare the server by installing the necessary packages for the environment you want to build.
- python (pip)
- openjdk
- ansible (using pip)
- Ansible collection for Microsoft AD management -> ansible-galaxy collection install microsoft.ad

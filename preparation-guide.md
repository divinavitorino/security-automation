# Preparation Guide

Automation for Windows environments can be tricky. 
Due to its particularities and Operating System architecture, setting up this environment may require additional time. 
However, the good news is: this is a preparation that is done only once. Then, just develop the playbooks according to your needs and youâ€™re done. I will leave the ones I developed for my project to serve you as a guide.

# Infrastructure Requirements

Putting together the information from the providers, a server with the configuration below can be a good starting point:
- 8GB RAM,
- 100GB disk
- 2 processing cores

> [!NOTE]
> This scenario can suit a small to medium-sized company.
> But it is important to evaluate the processing and memory load to ensure that there are no bottlenecks in the execution of processes.

Other important infrastructure requirements:
- DNS entry, to allow access by name
- Configuring Firewall Rules to allow connection between the Ansible server and Active Directory
- Enable the WinRM service on Active Directory servers to allow remote access (using connection via HTTPS)

# Preparing the Server

In this scenario, I deployed Ansible and Jenkins on the same server (that uses Ubuntu 22.04), using the Azure cloud. However, from this point on, the chosen architecture (on-premises or cloud) will make little difference.
You can check the compatible OS versions [here](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/installation_distros.html).
Starting from the scratch, you can prepare the server by installing the necessary packages for the environment you want to build.

## Package installation

- python 
- openjdk 
- ansible

python3 -m pip install --user ansible

- Ansible collection for Microsoft AD management

ansible-galaxy collection install microsoft.ad

- Kerberos library for Python ->  apt-get -y install python-dev libkrb5-dev krb5-user
- Kerberos Client ->pip install krb5
- Remote access using WINRM -> pip install pywinrm

## Configuration files

- /etc/hosts -> include the IP address and name of the Active Directory Servers
- /etc/krb5.conf -> configure the Active Directory Servers on the sessions:

[realms]

    MY.DOMAIN.COM = {
    
        kdc = domain-controller1.my.domain.com
        
        kdc = domain-controller2.my.domain.com
    }

[domain_realm]
    
    .my.domain.com = MY.DOMAIN.COM
